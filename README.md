# The Design Repository

This README will be better fleshed out in the near future. in the meantime, 
you can read about this project 
[here](https://blog.ephemeralrogue.xyz/the-design-repository).

## The Goal
A Single Page Application (SPA) with client-side rendering of two components:
1. tag cloud where each tag is a link that will render the 
2. content component displaying the tagged resources

## TODO
- add MongoDB connection
- build GraphQL resolvers to retrieve data
- write algorithm to display resources by tag
- make the frontend pretty

## Contributing to Frontend Development
with regard to the general development of what currently exists here:


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
